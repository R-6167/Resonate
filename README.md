# Resonate — Modes Lab

This branch is intentionally **Modes-only**.

It contains the independent Modes Engine for Resonate:
- listening modes and mode policies
- media-type classification
- user media-type overrides
- playback/context integration contracts
- Modes UI
- focused unit tests
- a minimal Flutter package definition

It does **not** contain the main Resonate playback engine, DJ engine, DSP engine, library, intelligence engine, or unrelated screens/providers.

## Integration model

User intent → Modes policy → existing Resonate playback/intelligence engines

The main app will provide adapters for the integration contracts in `lib/modes/integration/`. Modes must never become a second playback engine.

## Current modes

Normal, Running, Driving, Work, Podcast, Motivation, Audiobook.

## Branch purpose

Bake and test Modes independently. When complete, merge the Modes module into a working Resonate branch and connect the adapters there.
